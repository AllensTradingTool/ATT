	<h1>About</h1>


	<div class="textBox" id="basic" >
		<h2>Basics</h2>
		The Allen's Trading Tool (ATT) is a combination of 4 Simple Moving Averages 
		plotted together on a line chart. The values are based on the closing price of the daily time 
		frame. Each value is also rounded off, this makes the lines have more of a "stepping" pattern rather than 
		a "smooth" one. <br><br>
		
		When the deviance between the 4 averages is less than 1% then this usually leads to big changes in 
		price movement. This is in relation to how price action behaves. Price action will make dramatic moves 
		followed by consolidation, then another big move. The lower deviance between averages means that a stock 
		is in the consolidation phase and a big move is likely to follow. <br><br>

		Thus, this indicator will place a buy signal (green cross) whenever the deviance between the 4 averages is
		at a point of tight consolidation.

	<div class="textBox" id="howItWorks">
		<h2>How it Works</h2>
		The ATT was coded in and runs on the Node.js framework (so the code is primarily JavaScript). The program uses Node.js to gather market data (provided by Alphavantage's API), and displays the results through an HTML page that is generated by the program.<br><br>

		ATT also starts an HTTP server on your local machine (127.0.0.1) on port 1235. This is so the program can generate the HTML file, then serve the file via "127.0.0.1:1235" in your browser.<br><br>

		This project has multipule dependencies that I would like to mention...<br><br>

		<b><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a></b> - A JavaScript runtime library that allows people to create server side code but in JavaScript<br>
		<b><a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/">AlphaVantage API</a></b> - An amazing API that offers stock data (even intraday) completely for free. <br>
		<b><a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">Chart.js</a></b> - A JavaScript library for constructing charts.<br>
		<b><a href="https://github.com/axios/axios">Axios</a></b> - HTTP client for handling HTTP requests between the Node.js application and the HTML page.
